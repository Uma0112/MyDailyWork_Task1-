ðŸŽ¬ Movie Genre Classification
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a Movie Genre Classification System that predicts the genre of a movie based on its description. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models to classify movies into different genres.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-Learn
Pandas & NumPy
NLTK / SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
TF-IDF Vectorization
Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / Random Forest (for classification)
Git & GitHub (for version control)
ðŸ”§ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository
bash

python train_model.py
ðŸš€ How It Works
Data Preprocessing:
Text cleaning (removal of stopwords, lemmatization)
TF-IDF vectorization
Handling class imbalance using Stratified Sampling
Model Training & Evaluation:
Training using ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
Performance evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Saving the best model
Prediction:
The trained model predicts movie genres based on new descriptions
ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
Precision, Recall, F1-score (Printed using classification_report)
Confusion Matrix
ðŸ”¥ To-Do List
âœ… Implement stratified sampling for better dataset handling
âœ… Print classification report for better evaluation
ðŸ”² Improve accuracy using Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers)
ðŸ”² Deploy model as a Web API using Flask / FastAPI
